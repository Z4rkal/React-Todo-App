This is a simple todo-list app built with ReactJS.

You can clone this project to your machine with `git clone "git@github.com:Z4rkal/React-Todo-App.git"` and if you have Node Package Manager you can download the dependencies with `npm install` and launch the server with `npm start`.

The React app lets you add, edit, mark as completed, and remove 'to-do' items in a list displayed on the right, and the page communicates any changes to the 'to-do' list with the backend express server so that the data is persistent for as long as the server runs. There isn't a database or any user checking at the moment however; the server only has a single data array which makes this project more suited for personal use if anything.

The server is set to listen on port 3000.

A working example of the project is deployed on [Now](https://react100-vstda.zarkal.now.sh/)
